## ABOUT THIS PROJECT

This is a customer management system for a computer repair shop. It allows a repairshop owner or manager add employees to the system thereby giving them access to log into the system and then see what tickets (repair tasks) are currently open and need attending to as well as allow the right people to view customer information defined by permissions.

Also this project allows managers and admins to make changes to tickets and customers such as determining if the customer is still active, or if the ticket is completed among other priviledges.

This project was built to allow me to learn NEXT.JS
